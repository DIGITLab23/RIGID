Xs includes inputs, each of which includes seven variables.
x1, x2, x3: material of each layer. qualitative
x4: geometric type of unit cell. qualitative
x5, x6, x7: thickness of each layer. quantitative

Ys includes outputs (profiles), each of which is absorbance w.r.t. frequency. I am using 17 points of discretization for a profile

Provisionally, let's assume that we pursue a design with large absorbance. You can set threshold property for "large": e.g., 0.9 or 0.95. Ideally we will want to figure out designs with broadband absorbance performance
